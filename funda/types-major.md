# Types (Major)

BGV- 2nd gen, by Zvika Brakerski, Craig Gentry, and Vinod Vaikuntanathan, the OG

BFV - 2nd gen, used for modular arithmetic

CKKS - 4th gen scheme, most efficient out of all , arithmetic of approximate numbers



4 steps -> encoding, encrytping, decrypting and decoding

BGV, BFV are RLWE schemes and use polynomials from.$$Z[X]/Xn+1$$  as secret keys/pubic keys.
